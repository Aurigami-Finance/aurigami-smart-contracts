# Bug Bounty

The Aurigami bug bounty program is focused on our smart contracts, websites, and apps with a primary interest in the prevention of loss of user funds, either by direct draining of locked funds or social engineering attacks by redirecting users or forcing them to sign a transaction.

Submit a bug or learn more about the program on [Immunefi](https://aurigami.com/bug-bounty).

## Rewards by threat level

Rewards are distributed according to the impact of the vulnerability based on the  [Immunefi Vulnerability Severity Classification System V2.2](https://immunefi.com/immunefi-vulnerability-severity-classification-system-v2-2/). This is a simplified 5-level scale, with separate scales for websites/apps, smart contracts, and blockchains/DLTs, focusing on the impact of the vulnerability reported.

**Smart Contracts and Blockchain**

| Level    |                   |
| :------- | :---------------- |
| Critical | Up to USD 500,000 |
| High     | USD $20,000       |
| Medium   | USD $5,000        |

**Websites and Applications**

| Level    |             |
| :------- | :---------- |
| Critical | USD $10,000 |
| High     | USD $5,000  |
| Medium   | USD $2,500  |

All web/app bug reports must come with a PoC with an end-effect impacting an asset-in-scope in order to be considered for a reward. Explanations and statements are not accepted as PoC and code is required.

Critical smart contract vulnerabilities are capped at 10% of economic damage, primarily taking into consideration funds at risk, but also PR and branding aspects, at the discretion of the team. However, there is a minimum reward of **USD 50 000.**

All vulnerabilities marked in [https://github.com/Aurigami-Finance/aurigami-smart-contracts/tree/main/docs](https://github.com/Aurigami-Finance/aurigami-smart-contracts/tree/main/docs)  are not eligible for a reward.

Payouts are handled by the **Aurigami** team directly and are denominated in USD. However, payouts are done in **USDC and PLY,** up to 80% of the rewards can be paid in PLY..
